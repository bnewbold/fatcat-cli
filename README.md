**fatcat-cli**: command-line utility for interacting with https://fatcat.wiki API


## History / Status

This side-project is currently a work-in-progress.

Eventually intend to merge this repo back in to the main fatcat git repo, but
it currently uses a newer version of the openapi code generator tool. Updating
the fatcat API server rust code (`fatcatd`) will take a good deal of
refactoring, and this version of the codegen tool isn't even stable at the time
this fork started.
